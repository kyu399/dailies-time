# dailies-time
This is my personal project, just making a dailies tracker for gachas. I'll change how it works over time.

For the time being, the gachas of choice will be anything I have played actively before. I will make the choices available larger as I go and gain more abilities.

The first iteration will be a simple HTML website with me spelling out the time in PDT.
Over time, I intend to add an interactive clock that shows both the time resets happen in one's local time and also the time remaining until the reset happens.
